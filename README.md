# [Multiple Disease Detector](https://pneumoniadetector.azurewebsites.net)

## About

This webapp was developed using Flask Web Framework and is deployed on Microsoft Azure. The model used to predict the disease was trained on a large Dataset. All the links for datasets and the model used for model creation are mentioned below in this readme. The webapp can predict following Diseases:

- Diabetes
- Pneumonia

## Model with their Accuracy of Prediction

| Disease        | Type of Model            | Accuracy |
| -------------- | ------------------------ | -------- |
| Diabetes       | Machine Learning Model   | 98.25%   |
| Pneumonia      | Deep Learning Model(CNN) | 95%      |
